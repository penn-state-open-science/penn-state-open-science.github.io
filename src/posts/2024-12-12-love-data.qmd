Penn State joins institutions around the globe for [International Love Data Week](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/about/cms/3799), February 10-14, 2025. Most of Penn State's activities occur in conjunction with the [Big Ten Academic Alliance](https://btaa.org).

An activity of particular interest to open Big Ten scholars is the data visualization (data viz) [championship](https://btaa.org/research/love-data-week/compete-in-the-2025-data-viz-championship).
The competition has separate categories for students (grad or undergrad) and faculty/staff.
