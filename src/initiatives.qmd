## Surveys

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
We surveyed the research community about its knowledge of and interest in open science/open scholarship initiative in late 2022 and early 2023. 
Our findings are [here](https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/survey-fall-2022/) and the full repository is [here](https://github.com/penn-state-open-science/survey-fall-2022).
A notable feature of this survey is the use of a fully-shared [IRB protocol application](https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/survey-fall-2022/hrp-591.html).
